PART 1 PROJECT DESCRIPTION:

In Part 1 of this project, I began by creating an ASP.NET MVC application named "SalmasBookStore" using Visual Studio 2019. 
I made various configurations, including setting up Individual User Accounts for authentication and enabling Razor runtime
compilation. I also established a GitHub repository, reviewed the default application, and added a project description 
in the README.md file. In the process, I made several changes to the project's styling by incorporating a Bootstrap theme (Lux)
from the website Bootswatch.com and modified CSS files and views. I then, added three new projects, resolved errors related to 
namespaces and references, and created an "SD.cs" class in the Utility project. Additionally, I set up "Customer" and "Admin" areas 
in the application, customized their views, and successfully committed these changes to GitHub, marking to the end of Part 1 of the project.
